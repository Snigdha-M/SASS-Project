This report aims to examine total energy usage in Chicago with the goal of further enhancing efficiency and reducing emissions in the city. It helps in understanding the patterns of energy consumption and the emissions caused, while focusing on natural gas use, electricity use, as well as greenhouse gas emissions across diverse building types and their ages. Our objective is to analyse trends between different types of energy consumptions and how they are affected by building attributes in a number of years in Chicago.
